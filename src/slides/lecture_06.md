Vis (and interactive vis in particular) helps "where seeing the dataset
structure in detail is better than seeing only a brief summary of it"
(Munzner, 2016)

Why use interactivity (Munzner, 2016):

- Handle complexity
- Cause the view to change (many maps/stories in one!)
- Support investigation at multiple levels of detail
- Expand the capabilities of vis (many idioms depend on it)
