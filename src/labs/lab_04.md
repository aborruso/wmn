# Lab 4 - Acquiring data from the web in Python

In this lab, we will interact with a few APIs to get a feel for how they work and how you can make the most of them when trying to access data on the web. To follow this session, you will need to be able to access the following:

- The internet
- A Python installation such as the "Geographic Data Science Stack 2019" in the University of Liverpool computers, or the `gds_env` Docker container in your own machine (see [here](http://darribas.org/gds19/software.html) for instructions) 

## UK Police API

## Basemaps API

This section will cover the access of basemaps served as tilesets through the standard XYZ protocol. For this, we will use the `contextily` library, first as end-users, and then we will peak a bit into its guts to get a better understanding of its inner workings.
