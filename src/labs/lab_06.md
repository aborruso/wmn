# Lab 2 - CARTO Sandbox

In this lab, we will play with a sandboxed web mapping platform. By sandboxed
we mean that you will not have to think, for now, about getting your data,
processing, uploading or prepare them for mapping. It will all be ready for
you to start mapping.

The focus on this lab is on getting our hands dirty with some of the
design principles we have seen in the lecture
