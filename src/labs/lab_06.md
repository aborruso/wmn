# Lab 6 - CARTO Sandbox

In this lab, we will play with a sandboxed web mapping platform. By sandboxed
we mean that you will not have to think, for now, about getting your data,
processing, uploading or prepare them for mapping. It will all be ready for
you to start mapping.

The focus on this lab is on getting our hands dirty with some of the
design principles we have seen in the lecture, and to explore CARTO in the
meantime too!

## Explore the CARTO interface

We will use the 2019 IMD dataset, which has been uploaded to CARTO already.

Let's walk through the basics of CARTO as a (web) GIS:

- Data section: upload the file
- Maps section
    - New map
    - Main/side pane
    - Basemap: pick your background
    - Main layer: focus on `style` for now
        - `STYLE`
        - `POP-UP`
        - `LEGEND`

## CARTO Mapping

Now you now the very basics of CARTO, let's make a few maps! 
For this exercise, team up in **groups of two or three** students.

- ***Make the worst map you can***

Think of the [lecture on designing visualisations and maps]({{site.baseurl}}/blocks/b06)
and try to actively
ignore every piece of advice we've discussed in class. This of course means
you can't ignore the advice but you have to actively not follow any aspects of
what makes a good map good.

Once you're happy with your worst possible map, share it with class. Discuss
what is *wrong* about those maps and how they could be improved.

- ***Make the best map you can***

Now you know how to make a bad map, try your best to make an awesome map. Once
you hare happy with the results, share it with the group and explain what you
think makes the maps great.
